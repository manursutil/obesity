# Pediatric Obesity & Nutrition Evaluator

This is a web application built to assist pediatricians in evaluating a child's growth metrics and generating personalized weekly meal plans based on WHO standards. It is designed to be used by a healthcare professional (in this case, my mother) in clinical practice.
